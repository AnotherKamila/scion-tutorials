This also includes the steps required to install the necessary packages. For details on how to build SCION on a Raspberry Pi, please take a look at \nhow to build SCION on a Raspberry Pi\n.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe following steps will guide you through the installation of the tools necessary for running SCION.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nYou can skip prerequisites if you have your Go workspaces already configured on your machine.\n\n\n\n\nStep One \u2013 install Go\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to run SCION, you must have Go version 1.8.x installed. Download \nGo tools\n and extract them in \n/usr/local\n with the following command (with root permissions):\n\n\ntar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.8.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, add the newly extracted binaries to \n$PATH\n:\n\n\necho\n \n'PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin'\n >> ~/.profile\n\nsource\n ~/.profile\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your Go installation with the following command:\n\n\ngo version\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output should be \ngo version go1.8.5 linux/amd64\n.\n\n\nStep Two \u2013 configure your Go workspace\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter the installation of Go tools, it is necessary to set up your \nGo workspace\n. The following commands will create a default workspace at \n~/go\n and export it as the \n$GOPATH\n environment variable:\n\n\necho\n \n'export GOPATH=\"$HOME/go\"'\n >> ~/.profile\n\nsource\n ~/.profile\nmkdir -p \n\"\n$GOPATH\n/bin\"\n\n\necho\n \n'PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin'\n >> ~/.profile\n\nsource\n ~/.profile\n\n\n\n\n\nSCION installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nStep One \u2013 clone the SCION repository\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter the Go workspace has been configured, we can checkout the SCION repository from github.com with all dependencies using the following commands:\n\n\nmkdir -p \n\"\n$GOPATH\n/src/github.com/netsec-ethz\"\n\n\ncd\n \n\"\n$GOPATH\n/src/github.com/netsec-ethz\"\n\ngit clone --recursive -b scionlab git@github.com:netsec-ethz/scion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the machine doesn't have generated SSH keys or the SSH keys are not assigned to the github account, the checkout will fail with the error \nPermission denied (publickey)\n. There are two ways to resolve this problem:\n\n\n\n\nChanging the checkout using ssh to https:\n\ngit config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git@github.com:\n\n\nAssign SSH keys to Github account, detailed instruction can be found on \nGithub help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will clone SCION and resolve dependencies in the appropriate directory in the Go workspace. It is necessary to navigate to the newly downloaded repository for finishing the configuration:\n\n\ncd\n \n$GOPATH\n/src/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Two \u2013 finish installing the required packages\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to instal dependencies, simply issue the following command while in the root directory of the SCION installation:\n\n\n./env/deps\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will finish installing the required dependencies and system packages.\n\n\nStep Three \u2013 configure the host Zookeeper instance\n\u00b6\n\n\nReplacing \n/etc/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg\n with the file \ndocker/zoo.cfg\n is recommended. This has the standard parameters set, as well as using a ram disk for the data log, which greatly improves the performance of Zookeeper (at the cost of reliability, so it should only be done in a testing environment).\n\n\ncp docker/zoo.cfg /etc/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter finishing the installation of SCION, there are different ways of running different topologies. The following tutorials will cover this in further detail:\n\n\n\n\nRunning a local network topology\n \u2013 Generate a sample topology and run SCION locally\n\n\nConnecting to SCIONLab with a static public IP address\n \u2013 Connect to the already running SCION topology\n\n\nConnecting to SCIONLab without a static public IP address\n \u2013 Connect to the already running SCION topology through an OpenVPN tunnel",

This tutorial assumes that you don't have a static public IP address or cannot receive traffic on UDP port 50000 from the outside network, and therefore it will use OpenVPN to proxy traffic.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you have a static public IP address and you can receive traffic on UDP port 50000, you should consider \nrunning the VM without VPN\n.\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nRunning SCION in a virtual machine requires VirtualBox and Vagrant to be installed on your system.\n\n\nStep One \u2013 install VirtualBox\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo install VirtualBox, follow the steps on the \nVirtualBox download page\n for your system.

You can access it over \nlocalhost:8000\n\nThis port is automatically forwarded inside the VM, so you can access SCION-viz from your normal host machine.\n\n\n\n\nSCION-viz uses libraries that are located in the \npython\n directory of the SCION repository.

You can access it over  localhost:8000 \nThis port is automatically forwarded inside the VM, so you can access SCION-viz from your normal host machine.   SCION-viz uses libraries that are located in the  python  directory of the SCION repository. In order to make those libraries visible, we need to export the  PYTHONPATH  environment variable.  echo   'export PYTHONPATH=\"$GOPATH/src/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion/python:$PYTHONPATH\"'  >> ~/.profile source  ~/.profile",
