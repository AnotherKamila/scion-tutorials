This also includes steps required to install necessary packages. For details on how to build SCION on RaspberryPI please take a look at \nHow to build SCION for Raspberry PI\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nFollowing steps will guide you through installation of required tools necessary for running SCION.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nYou can skip prerequisites if you have Go workspaces already configured on your machine.\n\n\n\n\nStep One - install Go\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to run SCION you must have Go version 1.8.x installed. Download \nGo tools\n and extract them in \n/usr/local\n with following command (with root permissions):\n\n\ntar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.8.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\nand add newly extracted binaries to PATH:\n\n\necho\n \n'PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin'\n >> ~/.profile\n\nsource\n ~/.profile\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your Go installation with following command:\n\n\ngo version\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd output should be: \ngo version go1.8.5 linux/amd64\n\n\nStep Two - configuring Go workspace\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter installation of Go tools, it is necessary to setup \nGo workspace\n. Following commands will create default workspace at \n~/go\n and export it as \n$GOPATH\n environment variable.\n\n\necho\n \n'export GOPATH=\"$HOME/go\"'\n >> ~/.profile\n\nsource\n ~/.profile\nmkdir -p \n\"\n$GOPATH\n/bin\"\n\n\necho\n \n'PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin'\n >> ~/.profile\n\nsource\n ~/.profile\n\n\n\n\n\nSCION Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nStep One - Checkout repository\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter go workspace has been configured, we can checkout SCION repository with all dependencies using following command:\n\n\nmkdir -p \n\"\n$GOPATH\n/src/github.com/netsec-ethz\"\n\n\ncd\n \n\"\n$GOPATH\n/src/github.com/netsec-ethz\"\n\ngit clone --recursive -b scionlab git@github.com:netsec-ethz/scion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf the machine doesn't have generated ssh keys or ssh keys are not assigned to github account, checkout will fail with following error: \nPermission denied (publickey)\n. There are two ways to resolve this problem:\n\n\n\n\nChanging checkout using ssh to https: \n\ngit config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git@github.com:\n\n\nAssign SSH keys to Github account, detailed instruction can be found on \nGithub help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will clone SCION and resolve dependencies in appropriate directory in Go workspace. It is necessary to navigate to the newly downloaded repository for finishing the configuration.\n\n\ncd\n \n$GOPATH\n/src/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Two - Finish installing required packages\n\u00b6\n\n\nInstalling dependencies is fairly simple, while in root of \nscion\n repository it is necessary to execute following command:\n\n\n./env/deps\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will finish installing required dependencies and system packages.\n\n\nStep Three - Configure host Zookeeper instance\n\u00b6\n\n\nReplacing \n/etc/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg\n with file \ndocker/zoo.cfg\n is recommended. This has the standard parameters set, as well as using a ram disk for the data log, which greatly improves ZK performance (at the cost of reliability, so it should only be done in a testing environment). \n\n\ncp docker/zoo.cfg /etc/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter finishing installation of SCION there are different ways of running different topologies. Following tutorials will cover this in details.\n\n\n\n\nRunning topology locally\n - Generate sample topology and run SCION\n\n\nRunning topology on SCION Lab with public IP address\n - Connects to already running SCION topology \n\n\nRunning topology on SCION Lab without public IP address\n - Connects to already running SCION topology through OpenVPN tunnel.",

This tutorial assumes that you don't have static public IP address or cannot receive traffic on UDP port 50000 from outside network, and therefore it will use OpenVPN to proxy traffic.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you have static public IP address and you can receive traffic on UDP port 50000 you should consider \nrunning VM without VPN\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nRunning SION in virtual machine requires VirtualBox and Vagrant to be installed on your system.\n\n\nStep One - install VirtualBox\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo install VirtualBox follow steps on \nVirtualBox download page\n for your system. On Ubuntu or similar Linux distro you could also install VirtualBox using packet manager:\n\n\napt-get install virtualbox\n\n\n\n\n\nStep Two - install Vagrant\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo install vagrant follow steps on \nVagrant download page\n for your system. Also on Ubuntu you could install it from packet manager:\n\n\napt-get install vagrant\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning SCION\n\u00b6\n\n\nRunning SCION consists of several steps, registering SCION VM on \nSCIONLab Coordination Service\n, deploying VM and running SCION infrastructure.\n\n\nStep One - Download SCION VM\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to download VM with you must login to \nSCIONLab Coordination Service\n, in case you don't have an account follow Registration process.\n\n\nAfter successfully logging in, download VM configuration by clicking on \nCreate and Download SCIONLab VM Configuration\n as presented in image below:\n\n\n\n\nStep Two - Create and run VM\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen the configuration finishes downloading, extract archive content in separate directory. On a Linux system simply running \ntar\n command will extract contents in separate subdirectory named as your email:\n\n\ntar -xvf scion_lab_*.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter extracting newly downloaded content, navigate to extracted directory. It should have following structure:\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 client.conf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 gen\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dispatcher\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dispatcher.zlog.conf\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 supervisord.conf\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ISD1\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 AS1029\n\u2502           \u2514 ...\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 run.sh\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Vagrantfile\n\n\n\n\n\nVerifying that structure is the same and begin setup by running: \n\n\n./run.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked for root password, after entering it follow the steps in the installation process.\n\n\nStep Three - Run SCION infrastructure\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter successful installation of VM, you will be automatically ssh'ed into machine. \n\n\nTo run SCION you should navigate to source directory start infrastructure with following commands:\n\n\ncd\n go/src/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion/\n./scion.sh run\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter running SCION infrastructure it is necessary to verify that its running properly.
