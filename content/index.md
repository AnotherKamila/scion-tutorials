# Welcome to SCION Tutorials

## Introduction

This website provides step-by-step instructions on how to install and run the SCION infrastructure. It also provides a list of interesting projects that are using the SCION infrastructure for communication.

## Getting started

There are generally two ways of installing and running SCION infrastructure. First way is by downloading and running preconfigured Virtual Machines (VM) while second way is manual installation. We will cover both ways in tutorials.

## Running SCION infrastructure in VM

Easiest way to run SCION is by running preconfigured SCION Virtual Machine. Following tutorials are covering necessary steps for that:

* [Running SCION VM over OpenVPN](/virtual_machine_setup/dynamic_ip)
* [Running SCION VM with static public IP](/virtual_machine_setup/static_ip)

## Configuring SCION infrastructure manually

Following tutorials cover how to install, configure and run SCION infrastructure in a step-by-step manner. 

### 1. Installing SCION on different platforms:

* [Installing SCION on Ubuntu 16.04 x86 machine](native_setup/ubuntu_x86_build)
* [Installing SCION on Ubuntu MATE 16.04 - Raspberry PI](native_setup/rpi_ubuntu)

### 2. Setting up SCION topology

* [Configuring local topology](/general_scion_configuration/local_top)
* [Configuring AS and connecting to SCION network for devices with public static IP](/general_scion_configuration/public_ip)
* [Configuring AS and connecting to SCION network using OpenVPN](/general_scion_configuration/vpn_setup)
* [Configuring SCION endhost](/general_scion_configuration/setup_endhost)
