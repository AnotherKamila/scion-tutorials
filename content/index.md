# Welcome to SCION Tutorials

## Introduction

This website provides step-by-step instructions on how to install and run the SCION infrastructure. It also provides a list of interesting projects that are using the SCION infrastructure for communication.

## Getting started

SCION can run on different platforms:

- Natively
    1. Desktop installation &ndash; [Ubuntu 16.04 x86](native_setup/ubuntu_x86_build)
    2. Raspberry Pi build &ndash; [Ubuntu MATE](native_setup/rpi_ubuntu)
- In a virtual machine
    1. Setup for machines without static public IP address &ndash; [VPN based setup](virtual_machine_setup/dynamic_ip/)
    2. Setup for machines with static public IP address &ndash; [Static IP setup](virtual_machine_setup/static_ip/)

## Running and connecting to the SCION infrastructure

- Running a [local SCION topology](/general_scion_configuration/local_top)
- Connecting to the [SCIONLab network](/general_scion_configuration/vpn_setup)
